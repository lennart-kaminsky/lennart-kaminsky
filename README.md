# Hej and welcome!

I'm Lennart, most people call me Lenni, and besides mountainbiking and music I really want to get more into web development. That's why I'm now starting to do a web dev bootcamp at neuefische.

Luckily that's not me, but probably how I'll feel more than once in the next weeks.

## Some of my favorite records:
- Bon Iver - Bon Iver
- La Dispute - Wildlife
- Turnover - Peripheral Vision
- Ben Howard - Every Kingdom
